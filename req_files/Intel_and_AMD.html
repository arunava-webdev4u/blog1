                    Currently, you are reading this in whatever device that has a microprocessor inside. It changed our lifestyle. And talking about microprocessors, 
                    how can we talk about microprocessors without saying the name <b>Intel</b>, the face of the industry. Intel Corporation is an American multinational 
                    corporation and technology headquartered in Santa Clara, California, in Silicon Valley. It is the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor 
                    chip. Intel’s early history is legendary. Intel was founded on <b>July 18, 1968</b>, by semiconductor pioneers <b>Robert Noyce</b> and <b>Gordon 
                    Moore</b>, who had left Fairchild Semiconductor. Originally called <b>“NM Electronics”</b> — for Noyce and Moore — the company purchased the right 
                    to use the name “Intel,” short for Integrated Electronics, from a company called Intelco.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Intel paid $60,000 to buy the rights to its first core chip from Japanese calculator company Busicom, which was reportedly strapped for cash at 
                    the time. Intel with the help of Ted Hoff launched the world's first microprocessor, named <b>4004</b>, a 4-bit single-core 1/8-inch by 1/6-inch 
                    chip, on November 15, 1971, and it served as the foundation for Intel’s microprocessor-based computing. This “computer on a chip” had 2,300 MOS 
                    transistors that performed 60,000 OPS (operations per second) and cost $200.

                            Then Intel introduced the <b>8008</b> processor(200-800 kHz) on April 1, 1972. Intel’s first 8-bit (single-core) processor andit was 
                            twice powerful than 4004.

                            Intel’s improved microprocessor chip was introduced on April 1, 1974; the <b>8080</b> (2 MHz,8-bit single-core) became a standard in 
                            the computer industry. In 1980, the 4004 was followed by the 8080, which was chosen as the central processing unit of <b>IBM’s first 
                            personal computer</b>.

                            After that Intel introduced the <b>8085</b> processor in March 1976, Intel 8086(5 Mhz) on June 8, 1976, it was the first <b>16-bit 
                            processor</b>, it gave rise to the <b>x86 architecture</b>, which eventually became intel’s most successful line of processors.

                            This was a summary of processors launched by this giant brand. At today's date, intel already introduced the 10th gen processor. 
                            Intel became one of the most successful silicon chip processor manufacturers on today's date. But we also have to talk about AMD, 
                            another monster company at today's date, in this field.
