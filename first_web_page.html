                    If I ask you what is the biggest discoveries of mankind? Well, some of you will say <b>Wheel</b> it is, This primitive technology made it easier 
                    for all of us to travel. And some of you will say it is <b>fire</b>, though the fire is a natural phenomenon, its discovery marked a revolution 
                    in the pages of history. All thanks to our ancestors for leading us to the controlled use of fire which helps us from colorful lighting to 
                    delicious cooking. From the past to the present Fire has been in rituals, agriculture, cooking, generating heat and light, signaling, various 
                    industrial processes, cremation, and as a weapon or medium of destruction. And many other discoveries that had a great impact on lives.
                    <br>
                    But today we live in a <b>Digital Era</b>. Also known as <b>Information Age</b> or <b>Digital Age</b>, is a historic period at the beginning of the 20th 
                    century. It is a time of incredible growth. We already started to change the way we live our life. The whole human race is connected to the internet. The 
                    human race is more intertwined than ever before. But what was the invention that led us here? Well, the answer is the <b>Transistor</b>. The most common 
                    and the very basic unit of every electronic component. But to know its impact we just need to know the history. Before the existence of transistors, 
                    we used <b>vacuum tubes</b>.

                <h3><strong>First Generation</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    At that time, computers aren’t available to general people like today. During this time the history of computers was in its early stages. 
                    This was the <b>First Generation</b> of computers <b>(1940 – 1956)</b>. These early computers used vacuum tubes as circuitry and magnetic 
                    drums for memory. As a result, they were enormous, literally taking up entire rooms and costing a fortune to run. It was very power-hungry 
                    and subsequently generated a lot of heat which caused ongoing breakdowns.
                    <br>
                    But after the invention of transistors, the face of the industry was changed. On 23 December 1947 two employees working at Bell Labs in the 
                    US state of New Jersey, <b>John Bardeen</b> and <b>Walter Brattain</b>, assisted by William Shockley, created the first working <b> 
                    ‘point-contact transistor’</b>. John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley were awarded the Nobel Prize jointly in Physics 
                    for their work on the transistor. The device was a forerunner of components that would replace the bulky, fragile vacuum tubes.

                <h3><strong>Second Generation</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Then it came the <b>second generation</b> of computers <b>(1956 – 1963)</b>. Transistors weren’t used significantly in computers until the 
                    end of the 1950s. They were hugely superior to the vacuum tubes, making computers smaller, faster, cheaper and less heavy on electricity use. 
                    The language evolved from cryptic binary language to symbolic (<b>‘assembly’</b>) languages. This meant programmers could create instructions 
                    in words. At about the same time high-level programming languages were being developed (early versions of <b>COBOL</b> and <b>FORTRAN</b>).

                <h3><strong>Third Generation</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Then comes the <b>third generation</b> of computers<b>(1964 – 1971)</b>, The time of Integrated Circuits. In this phase, transistors were 
                    now being miniaturized and put on silicon chips (called semiconductors). The very basic component of transistors and processors today is 
                    Silicon. Baron Jons Jackob Berzelius discovered silicon (<b>Si</b>). This led to a massive increase in the speed and efficiency of these 
                    machines. Now users can interact using keyboards and monitors which interfaced with an operating system and enabled these machines to run 
                    several applications. As a result of these advances, machines made cheaper and smaller. The first working integrated circuit was developed 
                    by Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby. The first IC was demonstrated on September 12, 1958. (Geoffery Dummer is credited as being the first 
                    person to conceptualize and build a prototype of the integrated circuit).

                <h3><strong>Fourth Generation</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    The <b>fourth generation</b>> of computers <b>(1972 – 2010)</b>, The time of <b>Microprocessors</b>. This was a revolution that can be summed 
                    in one word: <b>Intel</b>. The chip-maker developed the <b>Intel 4004</b> chip in 1971, which positioned all computer components (CPU, 
                    memory, input/output controls) onto a single chip, now fit in the palm of a hand. Microprocessors even moved beyond the realm of computers 
                    and into an increasing number of everyday products.The increased power of these small computers meant they could be linked, creating 
                    networks. This ultimately led to the development, birth and rapid evolution of the Internet.

                <p>
                    <b>Fifth Generation</b> of computers <b>(2010)</b> The time of <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>. Computer devices with artificial intelligence 
                    are still in development, but some of these technologies are beginning to emerge and be used such as voice recognition. AI is a reality made 
                    possible by using parallel processing and superconductors.
